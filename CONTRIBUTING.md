# What Needs Doing

Feel free to work on minor improvements or quality of life features. Also feel free to take any of the [open issues](https://github.com/discord-math/bot/issues), unless they are marked as "spec needed".

For broader scope changes such as introducing brand new functionality, you should seek approval of the Meta Council.

# Tools

The code is type-checked with [pyright](https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/), and formatted with [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [isort](https://isort.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). These are run automatically on every pull request, and you should make sure all of the checks pass.
